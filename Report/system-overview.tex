% This is the core of the proposal.
	% It is where you spell out your technical plan and explain the project design.
	% Expected evaluation/demonstration issues would also be addressed in this section.
	% Use helpful figures such as~\rfig{example} and~\rfig{system-overview},
	% explain the figures in the text where you reference them.

		\subsection{Emergency App}
		Claude, Alessandro
		
		\subsection{Chat App}
		Joel, Pascal
			
			The Chat App ensures end to end encrypted messages via peer-to-peer connection through the flooding API. Encrypting and Decrypting messages is done public key cryptography. The keys are generated by the user and shared by QR codes that have to be scanned from the receiver.\\
			If the receiver's network is not connected to the sender's network the messages are buffered and will be sent to the receiver later when the receiver's and the sender's network are connected. The receiver is able to get as many messages as are stored in the buffer.\\
			
			When first starting the App the user has to enter his name and generate his public and private key. After generating the key the user is able to scan public keys from other members or provide his own public key for scanning. Upon scanning a new chat is displayed in the chat-list and a reminder appears to scan the public key of the chat partner. \\
			
			For group chats symmetric keys are used. Every chat will have an administrator who generates a symmetric key and can distribute the key to other group members.\\
			
			Pressing on a chat in the chat-list opens a chat to write and read messages.\\

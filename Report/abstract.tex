Again, its this time of the year, when all the large festivals and parades are. Its this time, when all of us give in on one of these and go there, like every year. 
You go there with a few friends and soon enough you will loose one of them, because the crowd is just too big and too loud. Every one of us knows this situation, right? \\
It's this situation when you really need to use your mobile phone, but ending up be annoyed about the absence of ANY reception. \\
So that's the point where we started... \\

We want a messaging system to work, even if you can't reach youre friends over the internet. We also wanted not only to program a messaging app for that purpose, rather then go a step further and build an API to provide these functionalities to users with even different approches than a "normal" messaging app. \\

Our approach to build such a network of nodes in an usable range for mobile devices, is to use WiFi Direct. The API will not only forward the messages to a server, it broadcasts the messages to all nodes. This gives us the highest possibility to get a message to a node without any reception. \\

So far, so good. But it's not finished yet. It's a lot more stuff needed then just broadcast a message through a network of devices. The API should allow a dynamic network structure, which means at any time a node can leave or join the network, it also should allow a kind of buffering the messages to allow reaching nodes which are not reachable for the network at that moment. This leads to a lot of challenging problems with replacement orderings, timeouts and so forth... \\

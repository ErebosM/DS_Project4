% The milestones section provides a work plan for carrying out the project.
% This is your schedule for getting the project done.
% Clearly state how the work packages will be distributed among the team members.

First of all the public function signatures of our API are defined and handed to the other group members that they can start with the Emergency App and the Chat App. Then the API team works at the remaining work packages and the other group members can start with their work on the emergency app and the chat app.\\[3mm]
Before the emergency app and the chat app can be tested the API has to be finished because the two apps rely on the message forwarding of the API.\\[3mm]
